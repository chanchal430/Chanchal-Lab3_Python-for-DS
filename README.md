### Objective:

    The Classification goal is to predict “heart disease” in a person with regards to different factors given.

### Context:

    Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death for people of most races in the US. At least 1 of 3 key risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking.
    Detecting and preventing the factors that have the greatest impact on heart disease is very important in healthcare. Machine learning methods may detect "patterns" from the data and can predict whether a patient is suffering from any heart disease or not..
